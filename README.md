# <Quiz Whiz!>

## Description

Test your skills as a beginner to JavaScript with the Quiz Whiz challenge! 

This quiz majorly tested my skills as a new developer. The hardest part was the local storage. I'm still struggling with how to properly set that up, but I'm sure I'll have plenty of other opportunittes to test that skill. I also learned how to add value and subtract value, create a clock, design a basic format and play with some different designs.
